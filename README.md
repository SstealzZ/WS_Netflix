# Netflix Workshop

![Netflix Workshop Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x300/FF0000/FFFFFF?text=Build+Your+Own+Netflix)

## Overview

This workshop guides you through building your own streaming media platform similar to Netflix using a stack of open-source software. You'll learn how to set up and connect multiple services using Docker to create a complete media management and streaming solution.

**Duration**: 2 hours

## Technologies

- **Plex**: Media server for streaming your media collection
- **Radarr**: Movie collection manager and automated downloader
- **Jackett**: API support for torrent trackers
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to easily manage all services
- **Transmission**: BitTorrent client (mentioned but not implemented in this workshop)


## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of containerization concepts
- An internet connection to download Docker images
- A computer with sufficient storage space for media files

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SstealzZ/WS_Netflix.git
cd WS_Netflix
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Plex claim token:

```
PLEX_CLAIM=claim-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Get your claim token from [https://plex.tv/claim](https://plex.tv/claim)

### 3. Start the Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all the required services: Plex, Radarr, and Jackett.

## Service Access

After starting the containers, you can access the services at:

| Service | URL                  | Description                               |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Plex    | http://localhost:32400/web | Media server interface              |
| Radarr  | http://localhost:7878      | Movie management                    |
| Jackett | http://localhost:9117      | Torrent indexer proxy              |

## Configuration Steps

### Plex Setup

1. Access Plex via http://localhost:32400/web
2. Follow the on-screen setup wizard
3. When prompted, add the `/movies` and `/series` directories as Libraries

### Jackett Configuration

1. Access Jackett via http://localhost:9117
2. Add indexers (torrent sites) that you wish to use
3. Note the API key generated by Jackett

### Radarr Setup

1. Access Radarr via http://localhost:7878
2. Configure the following settings:
   - Add `/movies` as your root folder
   - Set up Jackett as an indexer using the API key from the previous step
   - Note: We will not configure a download client in this workshop

## Test the Setup

Since this workshop does not use a download client for educational and legal reasons, we will test the setup manually with the open-source movie "Big Buck Bunny":

1. Manually download "Big Buck Bunny" from [its official site](https://peach.blender.org/download/)
2. Place the downloaded file directly in the `movies` directory (not in `downloads`)
3. In Radarr:
   - Go to "Movies" then click "Add New Movie"
   - Search for "Big Buck Bunny" and select it
   - Set your root folder to `/movies`
   - Under "Movie Path", ensure it points to where you placed the file
   - Click "Add Movie"
4. In Plex, scan your library to detect the new media
5. Verify that the movie appears correctly in both Radarr and Plex

**Note**: In a complete system, Radarr would communicate with a download client like Transmission, but this functionality is not implemented in this workshop. By manually adding the movie to Radarr, you can still experience how Radarr manages your media library.

## Legal Considerations

**Important**: This workshop is intended for educational purposes only. Users are responsible for:

- Only downloading content they have the legal right to access
- Complying with copyright laws in their jurisdiction
- Understanding the legal implications of using BitTorrent networks

## Why Transmission Is Not Included in This Workshop

For educational purposes, this workshop deliberately excludes the implementation of Transmission (BitTorrent client) to:

1. **Legal Compliance**: Avoid any potential facilitation of copyright infringement
2. **Educational Focus**: Maintain focus on media management and streaming infrastructure
3. **Ethical Considerations**: Promote responsible use of technology
4. **Alternative Demonstration**: Instead, we manually download the "Big Buck Bunny" open-source movie to demonstrate the workflow

While Transmission is a crucial component in a complete media automation system, participants who wish to implement it should:
- Research the legal implications in their jurisdiction
- Only use it to download content they have legal rights to access
- Understand that downloading copyrighted content without permission may be illegal in their region

## Next Steps

- Add Sonarr for TV Show management
- Implement Transmission for direct torrent downloading (with legal considerations in mind)
- Set up Overseerr for a more user-friendly request system
- Add Tautulli for Plex statistics and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
2. Review logs for specific services: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
3. Ensure proper network connectivity between containers
4. Verify file permissions on mounted volumes
